**Project Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Project Title:** EVANGELION Event Invitation and Tracking System

**Project Owner:** A large church organization with multiple states, branches, and zones.

---

## 1. Project Summary

The system is built to manage and track event invitations and logistics at multiple levels of the church hierarchy: State, Branch, and Zone. It also features an admin approval hierarchy to maintain operational control and decentralization. This PRD focuses only on the **Admin Structure**, **Admin Registration/Approval Flow**, and **Event Creation/Flow**. The Worker, Guest, and Registrar modules will be documented separately.

---

## 2. Organizational Structure

### Hierarchical Levels:

* **Super Admin** (seeded manually into the system)
* **State Admin**
* **Branch Admin**
* **Zonal Admin**

### Geo Hierarchy:

* States → Branches → Zones

Each admin type only has control and visibility over their jurisdiction.

## 4. Admin Onboarding Flow

| Admin Type   | Registration Required | Approval By  |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------ |
| Super Admin  | No (Seeded)           | N/A          |
| State Admin  | Yes                   | Super Admin  |
| Branch Admin | Yes                   | State Admin  |
| Zonal Admin  | Yes                   | Branch Admin |

---

## 5. Event Creation Flow

| Created By   | Scope        | Participation Flow           |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Super Admin  | All States   | State Admin selects branches |
| State Admin  | Their State  | Branch Admin selects zones   |
| Branch Admin | Their Branch | Zonal Admin assigns buses    |
| Zonal Admin  | Their Zone   | N/A                          |

### Notes:

* Events cascade downward automatically to dashboards when selected by the higher-level admin.
* No confirmation is required at any level.
* Each admin sees only relevant data based on their hierarchy.
* Bus pickup assignment is handled at the **Zone Admin** level and stored for reuse.

---

## 6. Mobile Responsiveness

* The system will be mobile responsive so admins can access dashboards and perform approvals or event tasks on mobile.

---

## 7. Authentication

* JWT-based authentication.
* Role-based access control per admin level.

---

## Next Section:

Separate PRD will be created to handle:

* Worker registration, volunteering, and guest registration flows.
* Registrar check-in operations.
* Communication logic for SMS/email notifications.
